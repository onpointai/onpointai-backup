<h2 id="f1-cars-predictor">F1 cars predictor</h2>

<p>Precict which team a car belongs to by analysing an image. The image can be from any angle.
This is an end-to-end example.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/DexterDSilva/f1cars-detector">Look here for Setup and Results</a></p>

<p>This is a good example of a complete workflow</p>
<ul>
  <li>collecting data using google web search (local)</li>
  <li>cleaning the data (removing duplicate images and other rubbish) (local)</li>
  <li>porting data to Google Colab - When i was doing this I did not have my Github a/c organised properly<br />
  Otherwise I would have done git init and ported the local repo to github<br />
  From Google Colab it is easy to clone the Github repo</li>
  <li>Once the data is in repo start a new jupyter notebook and select a GPU for training.</li>
  <li>Download the trained model to the local dir</li>
  <li>Modify the webapp to point to the trained model and do the predictions</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: I only used about 75 images per class (10 classes) to cut down on the training time.</p>

<p>I used Fastaiâ€™s recommended Starlette web api and with a bit of playing around with the css and html file got something suitable.</p>

<p>This is only meant for demo purposes and to motivate me to carry on with the ret of the course.</p>

<p>Suggested Improvements:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Add more training data</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Clean training data</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Overfit and then play around with hyperparameters</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Give webapp better UI</li>
</ul>
