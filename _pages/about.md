My name is Dexter D'Silva

I am an Aeronautical Engineer having worked at:  
Airbus Wing Shape Team (High Speed Aerodynamics).  
EADS Innovation Works.  
Racing Point Formula 1 team (Aero Design processes).  

I was always interested in writing macros, developing software on a one-off basis and saw myself writing advanced macros for [CATIA](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/?wockw=card_content_cta_1_url%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.3ds.com%2Fcatia%2F%22) automation initially in the field of wing shaping.

In 2017 I came across this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21EiKfQYZXc "NEWELEC") by Andrew Ng and since then I have been hooked on AI/Machine Learning and want to learn as much as I can about it with a view to applying my own spin on implementing flavours of it in the work that I do.

I am pretty good at connecting the dots of technology in the field of aero design where I work with CAD and CFD. I am always working on tutorials to build intuition about AI and explore it's feasibility in my daily work, where my domain knowledge will help me to enhance my value to my customer/employer.

The other area of interest is exploring the use of AI to analyse the huge amount of data generated by CFD, wind tunnel testing and on-track or flight testing and building tools to gain easy access to knowledge, to decipher, disseminate and democratise within the organisation.
