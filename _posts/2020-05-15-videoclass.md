title: Sports Video Classification - In Progress
---
The simplest way to classify the type of video is by examining individual frames of the video ie treat individual frames as images, classify the images and then do some sort of averaging or smoothing over a few frames to predict the current display.

Once we understand what goes on here  we can explore the ![other](https://blog.coast.ai/five-video-classification-methods-implemented-in-keras-and-tensorflow-99cad29cc0b5) methods which take up more setup and compute.

The main pacakeg here is [OpenCV](https://opencv.org), a library aimed at real-time computer vision tasks.





> This has tremendous potential for application in other areas

### Using Tensorflow and Keras

### Sports videos
