#### Powerful Quotes
* F Chollet:  
"You don’t need to know everything. You  don’t really need a formal background in this or that – though it helps, you don’t even need a PhD. You do, however, need to be constantly learning, be curious, read books. Don’t be “too busy” to learn, or otherwise proud of your ignorance."  
"Honestly, the question is not, and has never been, “ can ML replace radiologists/etc” (which won’t happen in the foreseeable future). The question is, how can radiology/etc utilise ML to improve outcomes, decrease the cost of car, and broaden accessibility."

* Geoff Hinton:  
“Read enough to develop your intuitions, then trust your intuitions.”

* Andrew Ng:  
"Deep Learning is a superpower. With it you can make a computer see, synthesize novel art, translate languages, render a medical diagnosis, or build pieces of a car that can drive itself. If that isn’t a superpower, I don’t know what is."
